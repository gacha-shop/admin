Please use the Task tool to launch the pr-creator agent to push my current branch to GitHub and create a pull request with a comprehensive description.

The agent will:
1. Analyze commit history and changes
2. Check for PR template in .github/ directory
3. Generate a detailed PR description
4. Push the branch to remote
5. Create the pull request using gh CLI
6. Provide the PR URL

Launch the pr-creator agent to handle this task autonomously.
