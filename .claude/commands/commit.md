description: Split changes into logical commits with Korean messages
argument-hint: "[optional message]"
---

Please use the Task tool to launch the commit-splitter agent to analyze my current changes and create logical, atomic commits with proper Korean commit messages following the (type) : content format.

The agent will:
1. Review all modified, added, and deleted files
2. Split changes into logical groups (features, fixes, docs, etc.)
3. Create separate commits for each logical unit
4. Use Korean conventional commit format: (type) : content

Launch the commit-splitter agent to handle this task autonomously.
